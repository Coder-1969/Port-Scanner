# Port Scanner

## Objective

Designing and creating a Python-based port scanner that can conduct TCP, UDP, Ping, and Stealth (SYN) scans to evaluate network security was the aim of this project. The scanner was built with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user convenience and was intended to deliver comprehensive scan results, including open/closed ports, protocols, and software versions. 

### Skills Learned

- Designed and implemented a Python-based network scanning tool supporting TCP, UDP, Ping, and Stealth (SYN) scans.
- Applied socket programming and Scapy for custom packet crafting and analysis.
- Built a user-friendly GUI with Tkinter, enhancing usability for non-technical users.
- Implemented CSV/TXT export functionality, improving reporting and result management.
- Strengthened understanding of network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP) and port states.
- Practiced secure coding principles and handled exceptions for stable runtime execution.
- Enhanced problem-solving and debugging skills by testing across different environments.
- Learned to document technical processes and testing results in a structured, academic style.

### Tools Used

- Python 3.12 – Core language for scanner development
- Scapy – Custom packet crafting for SYN and Ping scans
- Tkinter – GUI development for an interactive interface
- VS Code – Code editing and debugging environment
- Windows 11 – Development and testing platform
- Nmap – Benchmarking tool for validating scanner accuracy
